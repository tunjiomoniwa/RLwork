\documentclass[conference,compsoc]{IEEEtran}
% Some/most Computer Society conferences require the compsoc mode option,
% but others may want the standard conference format.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference,compsoc]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  % IEEE Computer Society needs nocompress option
  % requires cite.sty v4.0 or later (November 2003)
  \usepackage[nocompress]{cite}
\else
  % normal IEEE
  \usepackage{cite}
\fi
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite
% package with the nocompress option which is supported by cite.sty v4.0
% and later.





% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.

\begin{abstract}

Mobile edge computing (MEC) offers an information and communication technology environment with cloud computing capabilities within the radio access network (RAN). With increasing demand on real-time services, high-bandwidth, ultra-low latency, and minimal energy consumption from a massive number of devices, the fog-based Internet-of-things and MEC framework both have the potential to offer real-time, context-aware processing, and personalized services by leveraging proximity to end-users. However, mobility brings about several bottlenecks that hamper communication reliability within a network. This paper examines the uplink communication performance of an IoT end-device that leverages on a fog device, such as a 5G-enabled mobile device, to offload tasks to a remote MEC server situated at a macro base station. Putting into consideration the channel variations due to mobility of the fog device, we present a closed-form analytical expression for the achievable data rate. We then apply the stochastic gradient ascent optimization algorithm to the formulated problem in order to achieve convergence. Simulation results show an improved learning in the proposed algorithm.

\section{Introduction}
Mobile edge computing (MEC) has brought about immense potentials that could be derived from the 5G technology. Driven by diverse use cases such as the Internet of Things (IoT), public safety, explosive data usage, extreme video and gaming applications, and context-aware services, 5G brings about extreme requirements to the network. These requirements range from massive broadband to critical machine communication. As such, MEC will be a key building block in the evolution of mobile broadband and a fundamental technology and architectural concept. MEC entails hosting third-party authorized applications in the operator's network and allows for a synergy, where network providers and content providers can collaborate to provide an improved user experience. The MEC gives room for content developers to provide context-aware services by leveraging the real-time radio access network (RAN) information from MEC.

The emergence of MEC seems to have brought a lasting solution to imminent challenges such as high latency, slower application speed, and link failures, that often characterize the mobile cloud computing paradigm, however, distribution and allocation of computing resources, decisions on where and how to offload in cases of mobility and channel variations, remain a challenge in MEC~\cite{Yu2016}.
Designing a resilient network involves more than the addition of redundant links, it entails minimizing the communication outage by countervailing the impact of the wireless channel. In energy and resource-constrained environment such as IoT, it is often necessary for the IoT end-devices to offload some computation-intensive task unto a remote device or server. This device may not necessarily be situated in the far-away cloud, rather, it could be at the edge of the network. Several researchers~\cite{Lin16},~\cite{Chiang16} have highlighted the need to integrate the fog/edge computing paradigm with the IoT, in view of actualizing the IoT vision. The fog/edge computing based IoT (FECIoT) has the potential to meet the growing demands on real-time processing and data analytics.

The term ``FECIoT'' was first coined by Lin \textit{et al.} in~\cite{Lin16} with a motive to emphasize the immense potential that could be derived by integrating the fog/edge computing paradigm with the IoT architecture. The FECIoT framework consists of IoT end-devices, highly distributed and hierarchically-placed fog/edge devices, and the centralized cloud infrastructure~\cite{Chiang16}. Recently, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) MEC Industry Specification Group (ISG), was set up to find ways of standardizing the MEC to become an integral part of 5G systems driven by IoT. The ETSI MEC ISG was assigned the task of producing a set of specifications to allow third-party authorized applications to be hosted in a multi-vendor environment~\cite{Sabella16}. Questions may arise as to what roles MEC will play in the new FECIoT architectural framework. The MEC can readily be deployed in a distributed manner, leveraging on existing cellular infrastructures. Likewise, the FECIoT framework supports service provisioning at the edge of the network, with better prospects for small-to-medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).



In this paper, we consider an uplink communication scenario between an IoT end-device and the MEC server via a 5G-enabled fog device, usually a smartphone. We formulate an optimization problem that maximizes the achievable data rate, and then applied a stochastic gradient ascent optimization algorithm to improve the communication performance of the proposed scenario.

\section{System Model}
In this paper, we consider an uplink communication scenario as shown in Figure~\ref{MECmodel}, where an IoT end-device offloads data or service request to the MEC server via a 5G-enabled fog device, usually a smartphone.
