% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[journal]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are the platform for connecting intelligent Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. The data provided by
these intelligent devices can offer more insights about the overall futuristic functionalities in terms of usage
and preferences. Machine learning algorithms have been widely used for predictions, with several optimization algorithms using reinforcement learning techniques to improve the performance and interaction of devices within a dynamic IoT ecosystem. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art RL techniques that have been applied to solve trending problems in the IoT and cyber-physical systems domain. Furthermore, we give an in-depth analysis into its applications in the emerging fog-based IoT networks. Finally, we propose alternative research directions that may yield better outcomes.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{R}{einforcement} learning algorithms are the platform for connecting intelligent Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. Over the years, there has been several applications of machine learning (ML) in IoTs and Cyber-physical systems (CPS). Nest learning thermostats are good examples of how IoT devices leverage data patterns to predict the preferred temperature in a room during a particular time of day. The prediction of the room temperature can also be on an aggregated neighborhood level, where energy loads can be remotely shifted by the power utility in homes operating Nest devices. Another practical application is the Amazon personal assistant that has the capability of learning voice patterns, the Jaguar's Land Monitoring system, which depends on a complex software that allows the automobile to observe, predict, monitor and notify the car's passengers to assist the driver automatically delegate his tasks and minimize the burden of driving.

Optimization is a very old field with interesting algorithms that has been used to solve simple to complex problems in various areas. Many optimization algorithms use RL techniques to optimize the behaviour of devices in the IoT ecosystem. For instance, in Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), where cars act smartly, optimality in the interaction between cars and the environment is highly required. Several CPS applications like the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), smart grid, and ultimately smart cities, will allow intelligent machine-type interactions. These interactions may often will require robust algorithms that evolve and are adaptable, in order for the IoT devices to be able to achieve desired objectives given some set of operational parameters.

With the inherent heterogeneity in the IoT ecosystem and devices operating in a highly dynamic environment, it becomes necessary to leverage robust and resource-fitting machine learning techniques that will match the resource-constrained nature and stochastic behaviour of the IoT network. Moreover, the magnanimity of the IoT has led to the emergence of the fog-based IoT architecture~\cite{Omoniwa2018}, which promises to run IoT-enabled applications for real-time control and analytics, with millisecond response time. The realization of an optimal real-time control and data analytics is subject to the ability for agents to make optimal decisions that will improve the overall performance in the network. As such, we aim to examine RL techniques as used in previous works to help us understand the intrinsic benefits to the future IoT networks.

The contribution of our work is three-fold, which are listed as follows.
\indent
    \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*,label= \arabic*)]
      \item We review of some RL algorithms, and highlight key aspects that will drive future fog-based IoT networks.

      \item We also perform simulations on some techniques considering some IoT scenarios. We also present detailed RL applications and use cases within the CPS (Intelligent transportation systems, smart grid, smart homes, smart health-care, and smart environment) to demonstrate how different techniques presented in the paper fuse to provide desirable objectives.

      \item  We also present a variety of open research challenges and suggest possible future trends for building intelligence in IoT,
      with regard to the latest development in the field.
    \end{enumerate}


The remainder of this work is organized as follows.~In Section

\section{Reinforcement Learning in IoT}\label{sec:RLIoT}
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is learning that involves mapping situations to actions with an objective of maximizing a numerical reward. Actions are made by an agent, which have the ability to sense the state of the dynamic environment and consequently take actions that influence its environment. RL facilitates sequential decision making under uncertainty, thereby making it a useful tool in prediction of non-linear phenomenon~\cite{Zhang18}. Several works have been published in the area of RL in IoT and CPS, however, there has not been any detailed review that covers their applicability in IoT and the underlying research issues in this field.

\subsection{Basic Overview}

\subsubsection{Q-Learning}
Q-learning is also known as an off-policy temporal difference (TD) learning algorithm, which allows the agent to learn about an optimal policy using an exploratory policy~\cite{Watkins92},~\cite{Wen15},~\cite{Sutton98}. The Q-learning algorithm can be simply defined by

%ivana comment: cite original q-learning work by watkins

\begin{equation}\label{eqn1}
\begin{split}
Q_{t + 1}(s_t, a_t) &:= Q_{t}(s_t, a_t)\\
& + \alpha \Big[ r_{t + 1} + \gamma \max_{a}  Q_{t}(s_{t + 1}, a) -  Q_{t}(s_t, a_t) \Big].
   \end{split}
\end{equation}

%ivana comment: the statement below needs to be referenced. if it can't be backed up we can't say it - and i have a feeling we can't back it up as it sounds like a lot of speculation? who says it can be used either online, or to bootstrap, or for mission critical, or for real time? we either remove it, or add 4 references for each statement.

%Accepted
%Q-learning will play a very important role in future IoT networks since it is online, supports bootstrapping, and can be used for mission-critical, real-time IoT data.

\subsubsection{W-Learning}
Unlike Q-learning which is a single-agent, single-policy learning technique, W-learning is a multi-agent, multi-policy learning technique that has been used on non-cooperating agents~\cite{Dusparic2009}. The W-learning algorithm is given by

\begin{equation}\label{eqn2}
\begin{split}
W_{i}(s) &:= (1 - \alpha)W_{i}(s) \\
& + \alpha \Big[ Q_{i}(s, a_i)  - (r_i + \gamma \max_{a}  Q(s', a_i')) \Big].
   \end{split}
\end{equation}


\subsubsection{SARSA}
State-action-reward-state-action (SARSA) is an On-policy TD learning algorithm, which the agent learns an action-value function instead of a state-value function. SARSA always converges to an optimal policy so long as all state-action pairs are visited an infinite number of times.

\begin{equation}\label{eqn3}
\begin{split}
Q_{t + 1}(s_t, a_t) &:= Q_{t}(s_t, a_t)\\
& + \alpha \Big[ r_{t + 1} + \gamma Q_{t}(s_{t + 1}, a_{t + 1}) -  Q_{t}(s_t, a_t) \Big].
   \end{split}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG)}

\subsubsection{Normalized Advantage Functions (NAF)}

\subsubsection{Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C)}

\subsection{Related Works in IoT}
Over the years, many perceived difficult sub-problems have began to receive research attention, some of which are categorized as follows.
\indent
    \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*,label= \arabic*)]
      \item \textit{Energy allocation and utilization within the network}: IoT devices deplete energy in several ways, such as when transmitting and receiving data, listening to the medium, performing computation or even changing position. There exist several works that have used RL and its variants to optimize energy usage in different domains, some of which could be modified to suit the resource-limitation in the typical IoT domain. Zhong \emph{et al.} in \cite{Zhong2018} designed sensor energy utilization and power allocation in IoT sensors to maximize the total data throughput of the system. They proposed a low-complexity algorithm to optimally solve the two formulated sub-problems. The energy utilization sub-problem was formulated as a MDP, while the power allocation sub-problem was approached using discrete optimization. The proposed algorithm performed better than some simple heuristics when simulated. However, the work considered a scenario where the channel state is perfectly known.

          A Markov-based analytical model was integrated with a RL process in Conti \emph{et al.} \cite{Conti2017} to optimize the server activation policy, where optimal control of an energy storage system in a green fog-computing node is needed to improve the system performance, hereby allowing the system to bear high job arrivals even at low-power generation periods. The fog-computing nodes used in this work are not typical of those used in a typical fog-based IoT environment. A Q-learning-based adaptive power management was proposed by Debizet \emph{et al.} in \cite{Debizet2018} to optimize the power consumed during the suspend state of an Internet-of-Things (loT) System-on-Chip (SoC) with eight embedded power states. The algorithm out-performed some expert-based solution for most suspend sequences under 12000 cycles, however, with an additional power cost. Just like the traditional IoT architecture, the fog-based IoT networks are often power-constrained and as such, require low complexity learning algorithms to optimize the energy utilization.

       \item \textit{Latency Minimization}: Mission-critical and delay-sensitive IoT application can effectively leverage the intelligence of some RL techniques. An RL approach that made use of evolution strategies for real-time task assignment among fog servers was introduced by Mai \emph{et al.} in \cite{Mai2018} to minimize the total computation latency during a long-term period. The paper claimed that the proposed model is scalable when the number of IoT devices increases, however, no experimentations were carried out on a real-world IoT scenario. A dynamic programming based duty cycle control technique was employed by Li \emph{et al.} in \cite{Li2014} to provide an optimal solution to an inventory control problem. The focus was on optimizing the duty cycle by jointly considering energy efficiency, end-to-end delay and reliability of the network. A two-hop cluster tree network model was used in the work. A distributed multi-agent Q-learning algorithm was proposed by Liu \emph{et al.} in \cite{Liu2017} to optimize both the motorized and non-motorized traffic. The work considered several constraints to help depict real operational scenarios. The paper applied AI powered Internet-of-Things (AIoT) technologies for traffic light control, which is a key to the success of ITS. However, the approach was limited to stationary agents. A dynamic programming approach was deployed by Routray \emph{et al.} in \cite{routray2017} to provide near optimal results under high traffic conditions in an IoT network scenario with consideration for node mobility. A DP approach was used in routing in a dynamically changing network. However, all the nodes in the network were assumed to be routers, which is often not the case in a typical IoT environment.

           Despite the interesting proximity feature of IoT end-devices to the network edge in the fog-based IoT network, delay is prevalent due to several bottlenecks, which may lead system failure or operational hazard for critical applications. These techniques may be used to minimize the delay especially for high priority communications.

      \item \textit{Channel assessment and intelligent routing}: Prior to communicating via a link, it is very useful for nodes within the network to assess the communication medium. Learning by experience using some RL techniques will go a long way in minimizing number of loss packets in highly stochastic IoT environment. A Q-learning relay selection algorithm was introduced by Jadoon \emph{et al.} in \cite{Jadoon2017} to maximize the throughput in a typical cooperative network with relays supporting communication between source and destination. The relays were assumed to be the states, with three possible actions of remaining in the present state with relay~$r$ or choosing~$r + 1$ or~$r - 1$. However, the outage analysis was carried out without a closed-form expression for the outage probability within the network. Furthermore, in an attempt to reduce the complexity of the formulated problem, the problem algorithm did not consider the relays (states) which do not satisfy the minimum mutual information constraint. A scalable parallel Q-learning algorithm was introduced by Camelo \emph{et al.} in \cite{Camelo2016} to minimize communication cost. The work considered distributed and resource-constrained environment. A Q-learning-based duty cycle control technique was introduced by Li \emph{et al.} in \cite{Li2015} to provide improved performance and reliable M2M communication for IoT applications. However, the proposed Q-learning based duty cycle control only considered a two-hop cluster tree network in evaluating the performance of the system.

          Despite system dynamics and heterogeneity within the ultra-distributed IoT environment, it is important for devices which are mobile to move seamlessly without degradation of the quality of service (QoS) when communicating. Moreover, the communication should be ubiquitous irrespective of technology or domain within the system. As such, the RL techniques will play a very important role in areas of IoT device/service discovery, which will support adaptability and interfacing between devices and sub-networks within the IoT domain.
          %Furthermore, fog nodes/agents can learn the optimal route that will not only maximize the immediate reward, but future rewards, which may be based on the agent achieving certain targets.

      \item \textit{Scheduling}: Wen \emph{et al.} in \cite{Wen15} formulated an automated energy management system (EMS) rescheduling problem as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem. Simulations were carried out using Q-learning technique on a specific scenario with good results. The paper considers the EMS to act as an agent for energy users. A variant of Q-learning, Deep Q-learning, was introduced by Zhu \emph{et al.} in \cite{Zhu2018} to maximize system throughput by applying appropriate scheduling strategy for cognitive radio-based IoT networks. This work performed poorly when compared with the strategy iteration algorithm, though with a reduced computational complexity.

      \item \textit{Resource Allocation and Services}: An RL-based resource allocation in fog radio access networks was presented by Nassar \emph{et al.} in \cite{Nassar} for various IoT environments. A cooperative reinforcement learning algorithm was introduced by Khan \emph{et al.} in \cite{Khan2018} for adaptive power allocation in D2D communication. When compared with the Distributed RL algorithm, the proposed approach provides better system throughput as well as D2D throughput with less interference to pave way for the massive MTC in IoT. However, the experiments were conducted in a single cell. The RL-based mapping table (RLMT) and RL-based resource allocation algorithms were introduced  by Gai \emph{et al.} in \cite{Gai2018} to handle cost mapping tables creation and for optimal resource allocation in IoT content-centric services. The work was limited to the use QoE in examining service level, which allowed a dynamic resource allocation and avoided a fixed task table. A semi-supervised DRL model that suits IoT and smart city services was introduced in Mohammadi \emph{et al.} in \cite{Mohammadi2018}, using both labeled and unlabeled data for performance improvement and accuracy in the learning agent. The work employed an indoor localization based on the Bluetooth low energy signal strength, and limited its findings to a single floor of a building.

\subsection{Works in WSN}

In \cite{Chen2008}, a reliable and energy-efficient routing (REER) protocol was proposed using a geographic routing approach. The work considered the idea of a central entity, called a reference node (RN), which is assumed to be situated at an ideal location between source and destination. Several other cooperative nodes, which contend to relay data, are assumed to be situated around the RN. The work was able to examine the trade-off between reliability and energy-efficiency when the distances between RNs was adjusted. The work in \cite{Chen2011} proposed an improvement to \cite{Chen2008}, addressing the issue of scalability in a dynamic network. As such, a novel distributed multi-hop cooperative communication scheme (DMC) was proposed to improve certain QoS metrics such as the communication energy, hop count, and end-to-end delay. However, both works assumed complete prior knowledge of the network environment.
In \cite{Liang2009}, a multi-agent reinforcement learning-based multi-hop mesh cooperative (MRL-CC) mechanism for the improvement of some QoS metrics such as the end-to-end delay, packet delivery ratio in the WSNs. The work out-performed the work in \cite{Chen2009}, which incurred higher delay, and was distance-based, which is not suitable for a dynamic network environment. Though the mobility of the cooperative nodes were taken into account when learning the optimal policy, the MRL-CC failed to consider the power dissipated by the power-constrained devices.

A self-organizing RL technique for scheduling the wake-up cycles of nodes was proposed in \cite{Mihaylov} to effectively ensure the successful delivery of messages along a routing tree while minimizing interference. A node synchronization /desynchronization strategy was used to minimize interferences, as well as decrease the data retrieval and energy consumption. Experimentation was carried using three static topologies (line, mesh and grid) with results averaged over 50 runs, however, this does not depict a typical dynamic IoT environment. In \cite{Shah2007}, a distributed independent reinforcement learning (DIRL) techniques, which is based on Q-learning, was introduced to allow autonomous self-learning applications with inherent support for efficient task management. The DIRL approach showed significant performance improvement when compared to traditional static scheduling schemes. A resource management framework based on a two-tier RL scheme was proposed in \cite{Shah2013} to enable autonomous self-learning and adaptive applications with inherent support for efficient resource management. However, the works~\cite{Shah2007, Shah2013} only considered task scheduling.

A RL-based Q-routing technique, the Feedback Routing for Optimizing Multiple Sinks (FROMS), was proposed in \cite{Forster2007, Forster2007FROMS} to enable efficient routing to multiple sinks without overhead. Simulations were done under scenarios where the sink nodes are mobile and with consideration for node failure. However, the mobility pattern and speed was bounded. Moreover, an important cost metric such as the energy consumed by the mobile nodes was not considered. In \cite{Forster2008}, an evaluation was carried out on the previously proposed FROMS framework using real WSN hardware. The objective was to show that machine learning algorithms could be efficiently deployed on resource-constrained devices. However, during the implementation phase, certain bottlenecks were encountered such as dynamic memory allocation, interference in the wireless channel, poor data gathering, and difficulty in handling lost or corrupted packets. As such, a data clustering and aggregation approach, CLIQUE, was proposed in \cite{Forster2009} to minimize the energy expended by the selecting a cluster head using Q-learning. The approach was able to save significant amount of energy when compared to the traditional and random cluster head selection approach.

%\section{Practical issues that RL could be applied to IoT (thoughts when reading your paper)}
%
%To optimize based on the agent's ability learn different policies that are based on the following:
%\begin{itemize}
%  \item Power level (battery/energy per time of the relay/agent): Energy is very important in IoT networks as most devices are power-constrained. An agent within the network should be able to make decisions based on its local policies as well as the remote policies from neighbouring agents within the network.
%  \item Communication outage (based on the channel conditions/state of the environment/single hop): Every physical link, which is often wireless has unique channel conditions, and as such, the agent should be able to learn the optimal route.
%  \item Cooperative capability ( malicious agents/trusted nodes): In every network, there exist possibilities of having malicious agents. Overtime, the agent should learn how to avoid malicious agents.
%  \item Storage capability: In a distributed and heterogenous network where neighbour nodes/agents have different storage capacity. An RL-based technique could be used by the agent to learn. This will in turn minimize packet loss within the network.
%  \item Mobility patterns/metrics of agents and that of its neighbours: Considering a realistic IoT network where agents can be static or mobile, the  node degree of agents in the network will vary with time, and as such it will be necessary for an agent to consider the dynamics of neighbouring agents in the network.
%  \item Estimated transmission delay: The position of neighbours with the network has an important role to play in determining the delay. An agent should be able to learn and follow a policy that best minimizes network latency.
%  \item Noisy and dynamic environment:
%  \item The issue of full observability and partial observability MDPs: POMDPs are known to be intractable only for small problems.
