\documentclass[journal]{IEEEtran}
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[journal]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are the platform for connecting intelligent Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. The data provided by
these intelligent devices can offer more insights about the overall futuristic functionalities in terms of usage
and preferences. Machine learning algorithms have been widely used for predictions, with several optimization algorithms using reinforcement learning techniques to improve the performance and interaction of devices within a dynamic IoT ecosystem. We present a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art RL techniques that have been applied to solve trending problems in the IoT and cyber-physical systems domain. Furthermore, we give an in-depth analysis into such problems and propose alternative approaches that may yield better outcomes.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{R}{einforcement} learning algorithms are the platform for connecting intelligent Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. Over the years, there has been several applications of machine learning (ML) in IoTs and Cyber-physical systems (CPS). Nest learning thermostats are good examples of how IoT devices leverage data patterns to predict the preferred temperature in a room during a particular time of day. The prediction of the room temperature can also be on an aggregated neighborhood level, where energy loads can be remotely shifted by the power utility in homes operating Nest devices. Another practical application is the Amazon personal assistant that has the capability of learning voice patterns, the Jaguar's Land Monitoring system, which depends on a complex software that allows the automobile to observe, predict, monitor and notify the car's passengers to assist the driver automatically delegate his tasks and minimize the burden of driving.

Optimization is a very old field with interesting algorithms that has been used to solve simple to complex problems in various fields. Many optimization algorithms use RL techniques optimize the behaviour of devices in the IoT ecosystem. For instance, in Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), where cars act smartly, optimality in the interaction of the cars with the environment is highly required. Several CPS applications like the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), smart grid, and ultimately smart cities, will allow intelligent machine-type interactions. These interactions may often will require robust algorithms that evolve and are adaptable, in order for the IoT devices to be able to achieve desired objectives given some set of operational parameters.








The contribution of our work is four-fold, which are listed as follows.
\indent
    \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*,label= \arabic*)]
      \item We provide a exhaustive review of several RL algorithms, and highlight key aspects that will drive future IoT networks

      \item We carried out a detailed comparative study of various RL mechanisms. We also perform simulations on some techniques considering some IoT scenarios.

      \item We present detailed RL applications and use cases within the CPS (Intelligent transportation systems, smart grid, smart homes, smart health-care, and smart environment) to demonstrate how different techniques presented in the paper fuse to provide desirable objectives.

      \item  We also present a variety of open research challenges and suggest possible future trends for building intelligence in IoT,
      with regard to the latest development in the field.
    \end{enumerate}


The remainder of this work is organized as follows.~In Section

\section{Reinforcement Learning in IoT}\label{sec:RLIoT}
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is learning that involves mapping situations to actions with an objective of maximizing a numerical reward. Actions are made by an agent, which have the ability to sense the state of the dynamic environment and consequently take actions that influence its environment. RL facilitates sequential decision making under uncertainty, thereby making it a useful tool in prediction of non-linear phenomenon~\cite{Zhang18}. Several works have been published in the area of RL in IoT and CPS, however, there has not been any detailed review that covers their applicability in IoT and the underlying research issues in this field.

Over the years, many perceived difficult subproblems have began to receive research attention.


\subsection{Q-Learning}
Q-learning is also known as an off-policy temporal difference (TD) learning algorithm, which allows the agent to learn about an optimal policy using an exploratory policy~\cite{Wen15},~\cite{Sutton98}. The Q-learning algorithm can be simply defined by

\begin{equation}\label{eqn1}
\begin{split}
Q_{t + 1}(s_t, a_t) &:= Q_{t}(s_t, a_t)\\
& + \alpha \Big[ r_{t + 1} + \gamma \max_{a}  Q_{t}(s_{t + 1}, a) -  Q_{t}(s_t, a_t) \Big].
   \end{split}
\end{equation}

Q-learning will play a very important role in future IoT networks since it is online, supports bootstrapping, and can be used for mission-critical, real-time IoT data.

\subsection{W-Learning}
Unlike Q-learning which is a single-agent, single-policy learning technique, W-learning is a multi-agent, multi-policy learning technique that has been used on non-cooperating agents~\cite{Dusparic2009}. The W-learning algorithm is given by

\begin{equation}\label{eqn2}
\begin{split}
W_{i}(s) &:= (1 - \alpha)W_{i}(s) \\
& + \alpha \Big[ Q_{i}(s, a_i)  - (r_i + \gamma \max_{a}  Q(s', a_i')) \Big].
   \end{split}
\end{equation}


\subsection{SARSA}
State-action-reward-state-action (SARSA) is an On-policy TD learning algorithm, which the agent learns an action-value function instead of a state-value function. SARSA always converges to an optimal policy so long as all state-action pairs are visited an infinite number of times.

\begin{equation}\label{eqn3}
\begin{split}
Q_{t + 1}(s_t, a_t) &:= Q_{t}(s_t, a_t)\\
& + \alpha \Big[ r_{t + 1} + \gamma Q_{t}(s_{t + 1}, a_{t + 1}) -  Q_{t}(s_t, a_t) \Big].
   \end{split}
\end{equation}

\section{Practical issues that RL could be applied to IoT (thoughts when reading your paper)}

To optimize based on the agent's ability learn different policies that are based on the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Power level (battery/energy per time of the relay/agent): Energy is very important in IoT networks as most devices are power-constrained. An agent within the network should be able to make decisions based on its local policies as well as the remote policies from neighbouring agents within the network.
  \item Communication outage (based on the channel conditions/state of the environment/single hop): Every physical link, which is often wireless has unique channel conditions, and as such, the agent should be able to learn the optimal route.
  \item Cooperative capability ( malicious agents/trusted nodes): In every network, there exist possibilities of having malicious agents. Overtime, the agent should learn how to avoid malicious agents.
  \item Storage capability: In a distributed and heterogenous network where neighbour nodes/agents have different storage capacity. An RL-based technique could be used by the agent to learn. This will in turn minimize packet loss within the network.
  \item Mobility patterns/metrics of agents and that of its neighbours: Considering a realistic IoT network where agents can be static or mobile, the  node degree of agents in the network will vary with time, and as such it will be necessary for an agent to consider the dynamics of neighbouring agents in the network.
  \item Estimated transmission delay: The position of neighbours with the network has an important role to play in determining the delay. An agent should be able to learn and follow a policy that best minimizes network latency.
\end{itemize}

\section{Challenges we may face when implementing the above issues raised}

We know that devices/agents in an IoT network are computationally-constrained, it will be proper to deploy lightweight RL-based techniques (or any other machine learning approach) that will improve the efficiency of the network. Furthermore, we may have to experiment on a very dynamic environment considering factors that are equally stochastic, and ultimately allow for strict quality-of-service requirements.
