% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[journal]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***

  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with

% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at:

% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms offers more insights about the overall futuristic functionalities for intelligent Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. With the explosive growth in the number of IoT devices, as well as the highly-distributed deployments of these devices today, managing the IoT devices centrally becomes infeasible. As such, several disruptive paradigms have emerged, one of which is the fog computing-based IoT, which aim towards shifting computation, control, and decision-making closer to the network edge. However, mobility and power-constrain of these fog devices remains an issue of concern. In this paper, we aim to minimize the global outage in communication within a fog-based IoT network, by optimizing the power-control parameter of each potential mobile fog-relay agent (MFRA), as well as optimizing the physical position. As such, each MFRA is compelled to take certain actions that may influence its environment. We optimize the communication performance by applying a decentralized q-learning approach, with each MFRA acting independently, but contributing towards a global local-optimal policy. Furthermore, we show that our algorithm is scalable even with very large number of devices.

\section{Background}
\IEEEPARstart{T}{he} fog computing-based IoT paradigm aims at moving computation, control, and decision-making within the IoT ecosystem closer to the network edge~\cite{Omoniwa2018}. The key driver of this paradigm are fog devices, which may be energy-constrained or not, and can either be mobile or static. The deployment and efficient utilization of these fog devices will contribute to the success of future IoT systems~\cite{Chiangh2016}, one of which is serving as relays to overcome communication outages due to obstacles or long distances between a source node and a remote destination node where IoT services may be rendered.

However, in order for devices to communicate efficiently with minimal outage (loss of transmitted packets), several bottlenecks may arise, one of which is the efficient utilization of energy by power-constrained IoT devices. Energy can be used up when these devices unnecessarily increase their power-level in order to communicate with neighbouring devices within the network, conversely, energy can be saved when the devices regulate their transmission power, especially in situations when they are relatively close to the communicating parties. For example, an IoT end-device that transmits at high power irrespective of the channel conditions or proximity of its neighbours may drastically deplete its energy and die-out, hence, resulting in communication breakdown due to a point-of-failure within the network. Another challenge to be addressed is the energy consumed due to mobility. In order to deliver on some acceptable quality-of-service (QoS) within the IoT ecosystem, it is imperative for devices to be mobile, however, these devices are at risk of draining most of their energy on movement. For instance, energy will be inefficiently used if a power-constrained fog device decides to move closer to the communicating party only to relay very few numbers of packets, though having a guarantee that all the packets are delivered to the destination. However, if the size of the number of packets to be relayed is large, it may be optimal for the fog device to move closer, hence, conserving the energy of the IoT end-device, who can now transmit at a lower power level.

Moreover, since power-control mechanisms and smart mobility are critical in minimizing outages in communication, these devices should be able to learn when to increase, decrease, or maintain their power-levels or to move efficiently in order to increase the long-term performance of the network. More so, near-optimal actions from these devices are required to drive several smart cities applications, most importantly the Industrial IoT (IIoT), where industrial robots are deployed to act intelligibly in a dynamic industrial setting, and intelligent monitoring applications, where surveillance drones are deployed in militarised zones to meet stringent quality-of-service (QoS) requirements~\cite{OmoniwaRelay2018}.

The work in~\cite{OmoniwaRelay2018} used an iterative algorithm based on the steepest descent method to address the problem in a multi-tier fog-based IoT architecture with a fog device which could adjust its position and power-control parameter in order to minimize outage in communication. However, the work did not take into consideration the performance of the approach in a highly-decentralised IoT environment. In~\cite{Mozaffari2016}, a clustering algorithm was used on eight (8) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAVs) to collect data from ground IoT devices with an objective of minimizing the energy consumed by the IoT devices during uplink communications. However, this work considered a centralized network where the locations of every IoT device and UAV were known to the controller. Considering the highly-distributed nature of deployed IoT devices, it becomes infeasible to manage devices centrally~\cite{Wilhelmi2017}. As such, reinforcement learning can be effectively deployed on fog devices to allow them to act independently based on their local experiences in the environment, i.e. each fog device should be able to learn independently without a central entity.

A decentralised stateless Q-learning approach was proposed in \cite{Wilhelmi2017} to improve aggregate throughput in four coexistent wireless networks (WN). Each WN was considered to be an agent running the stateless Q-learning algorithm with agents having action space as channel number, and transmit power
(dBm). A lightweight distributed learning approach was proposed in \cite{Azari2018} to increase energy efficiency and reliability of IoT communications. There was significant performance improvement when the proposed algorithm was compared to a centralized optimized strategy. Transmit power, sub-channel, and spreading factor made up the action space. However, the system model in both works was rather hierarchical than distributed, ie. each WN was assumed to be an independent central entity with no specifications to what is learnt within each sub-network. Though IoT is defined as a large-scale network where various sub-networks coexist~\cite{Omoniwa2018}, applying RL to end-devices within sub-network may bring about meaningful performance improvement in the overall IoT network.

The main contribution of this paper is to propose a fully-decentralised multi-agent-based reinforcement learning approach as in~\cite{Gueriau2018} that addresses communication performance within a fog-based IoT architecture. First, we assumed a realistic scenario of possible state-action pair for each communication scenario as seen in  Fig. \ref{ideafig1}, where each fog-agent is faced with a unique topology and environment. Next, in order to guarantee energy-efficient communications for the fog devices in the dynamic environment, we apply a decentralised q-learning algorithm, where each agent observes its position with respect to the communicating party, likewise the size of the number of packets to be transmitted and learns to take actions that improve the long-term communication performance. The fog-agents will actively try to communicate with neighbouring IoT devices in a manner where computing and processing are fully-decentralised, as well as achieving energy balance within the system.

The remainder of this work is organized as follows.~In Section II, we reviewed related works, and present our proposed approach in Section III. In Section IV, we evaluate the proposed fog-based IoT system, and present the results in Section V. Section V concludes the paper and outlines future directions.

\section{Problem Definition}
We adopt an RL approach, in which an agent interacts with an environment over periods of time according to a policy~$\omega$. At every time-step~$k \in N$, the environment produces a state observation~$s_{k} \in \mathbb{R}^{D_s}$. By sampling, the agent then picks an action~$a_{k}$ over~$\omega(s_{k})$,~$a_{k} \in \mathbb{R}^{D_a}$, which is applied to the environment. The environment consequently produces a reward~$R(s_{k}, a_{k})$ and may end the episode at state~$s_{N}$ or transits to a new state~$s_{k + 1}$. The agent's goal is to minimize the expected cumulative cost,~$\min_{\omega} \mathbb{E}_{s_0, a_0, s_1, a_1, ..., s_N} \Big[ \sum_{i=0}^{N} \gamma^i \mathcal{C}(s_i) \Big]$, where~$0 \leq \gamma \leq 1$ is the discount factor, and~$\mathcal{C}$ is the overall cost function of our model.

\subsection{Problem Formulation}
\emph{\textbf{States}}: The states are defined as a tuple, $\langle$Outage communication cost ($\mathcal{P}_{out}$) /Energy status of the fog relay (J) /Energy status of the IoT sensor (J)$\rangle$.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Outage communication cost: Outage observations from the environment is estimated using (\ref{eqn1a}) from \cite{OmoniwaRelay2018}, which gives an estimate of the communication outage when the agent takes an action, such as changing power levels or location, or both.
  \item Energy expended by fog relay: This observation gives the agent insight on how much energy by the fog agent when following policy~$\omega_i \in \omega_{fog}$. If the fog agent continues to take sub-optimal actions, it depletes its energy and dies out.
  \item Energy expended by IoT sensor: This observation gives the agent insight on how much energy the IoT sensor has used up by following a policy~$\omega_i \in \omega_{IoT}$. If the IoT sensor continues to take sub-optimal actions, it depletes its energy and dies out.
\end{itemize}


\begin{equation}\label{eqn1a}
  \mathcal{P}_{out} = 1 - (1 + 2\Psi^2 \ln \Psi) \exp\Big( -\frac{N_0 \tilde{\kappa}}{P_{I} (D_{I} + \delta)^{-\sigma}}\Big),
\end{equation}


where~$\Psi = \sqrt{(N_0 \tilde{\kappa})/(P_{R}(D_{S} + \delta)^{-\sigma})}$, and~$\mathcal{P}_{out}$ is an expression for the outage probability with values between 0 and 1. We assume a predefined threshold~$\tilde{\kappa}$ which determines the outage in communication,~$P_{I}$ is transmit power of the IoT sensor,~$P_{R}$ is transmit power of the fog relay agent,~$D_{I}$ is the distance between IoT sensor and fog relay agent, and~$D_{S}$ is the distance between fog relay agent and destination node. We assume a small change in the position of the fog relay agent,~$\delta = 0.1m$,~$N_0$ to be the channel noise, and~$\sigma$ to be the path-loss exponent.

\emph{\textbf{Actions}}: The actions are move and transmit by fog, and select a power-level and transmit by IoT end-device, which make up eight possible actions.

 \begin{itemize}
  \item Mobility: Move by $\pm \delta$ and transmit, where~$\delta = 0.25m$ and mobility range = [-30m, 30m]
  \item Power-level: Choose power-level and transmit, $\rho$, where~transmit power ranges = [0.001W, 0.01W, 0.15W, 0.2W, 0.25W, 0.3W]
\end{itemize}

\emph{\textbf{Goal}}: The goal is for the agent to learn to minimize the overall cost~$\mathcal{C}$ in the tuple, $\langle$Outage communication cost ($\mathcal{P}_{out}$) /Energy status of the fog relay (J) /Energy status of the IoT sensor (J)$\rangle$, by keeping all nodes within the link alive while ensuring that the packets received in each transmission does not fall below the pre-defined threshold, which was set at 95\%.

\emph{\textbf{Rewards}}: The reward function used is given in (\ref{eqn1b}) as

 \begin{equation}\label{eqn1b}

      0, & \text{otherwise.}
    \end{cases}
  \end{equation}





\emph{\textbf{Metrics}}: Outage probability, i.e. the ratio of the number of packet lost to those transmitted, which we measure in percentages, and energy status of the fog relay agent and the IoT sensor, i.e. the ratio of depleted energy to the initial capacity in Joules, which we measure as a percentage.

\subsection{Related Works: Idea 1}
Considering the dynamics and heterogeneity within the ultra-distributed IoT environment, it is important for communication devices which are mobile to move seamlessly without degrading quality of service (QoS). More so, the constrained devices should communicate efficiently without depleting all their energy by transmitting at high-power, which may have long-term consequences to the network. Several non-RL-based approaches have been proposed to optimize the communication performance in IoT based networks, however, when some parameters in the network are changed, these approaches may fail.
The work in~\cite{OmoniwaRelay2018} considered a multi-tier fog-based IoT architecture where a mobile/static fog node acts as an amplify and forward relay that transmits received information from a IoT sensor node to a higher hierarchically-placed fog device, which offers some localized services. In order to minimize the outage in communication, an iterative algorithm based on the steepest descent method (SDM) was proposed to jointly optimize the mobility pattern and power-control parameters. However, the single-agent based work did not take into consideration the performance of the approach in a highly-decentralised IoT environment. Furthermore, each time the topology is changed, the agent will need to recompute the model in other to act optimally.

RL can be applied to a new environment, since the it allows the agent to learn, by take actions that will improve its long-term return. Furthermore, RL can be applied to multiple agents. In \cite{Wilhelmi2017}, a decentralised, multi-agent-based stateless Q-learning approach was proposed, where no information about neighbouring nodes are available to agents. Though the paper was able to improve aggregate throughput in the network, by allowing the networks modify both the transmission power and the channel used, however, high variability was observed in the throughput of the individual networks. Only eight agents were observed using a stateless Q-learning approach. The work did not adequately depict the distributed nature of the IoT network. Moreover, mobility of agents was completely ignored.

Several works in WSN have applied the decentralised RL technique. In \cite{Liang2009}, a multi-agent reinforcement learning-based multi-hop mesh cooperative (MRL-CC) mechanism for the improvement of some QoS metrics in the WSNs. Though the mobility of the cooperative nodes were taken into account when learning the optimal policy, the MRL-CC failed to consider the power dissipated by the power-constrained devices, as well as the overall outage in communication.

In \cite{Chen2008}, a reliable and energy-efficient routing (REER) protocol was proposed using a geographic routing approach. The work considered the idea of a central entity, called a reference node (RN), which is assumed to be situated at an ideal location between source and destination. Several other cooperative nodes, which contend to relay data, are assumed to be situated around the RN. The work was able to examine the trade-off between reliability and energy-efficiency when the distances between RNs was adjusted.


We present a fully-decentralised multi-agent reinforcement learning approach that adequately addresses some performance issues in IoT.
The main task of our work is to minimize global outage in communication within a fog-based IoT network, by optimizing the power-control parameter of the potential mobile fog-relay agent (MFRA), as well as optimizing the position of each relaying agents in the network. As such, each MFRA is compelled to take certain actions that may influence its environment. However, the duration it takes the MFRA to learn is significantly influenced by the state space, as well as the possible set of actions~\cite{Dusparic2009}. The variables for the state, action and reward of an agent may be discrete or continuous, with the former represented as small interval of values which imply distinct levels~\cite{Yau2012}, and can easily be represented in a tabular form. However, it is difficult to represent continuous space using Q-learning tables. The work in \cite{Vucevic2007} considered a RL agent that explores continuous state and action space using Gaussian unit search behaviour. Other works~\cite{Dusparic2009, Cuayahuitl2006} considered the reduction of states by eliminating states that are unlikely to occur. However, this may pose a big risk especially in a highly dynamic environment. RL can be effective for learning action policies in discrete stochastic environments, but its efficiency can decay exponentially with increasing state space~\cite{Uther1998}. Our proposed problem can be observed to have continuous state-action pairs, and is approached by discretizing the state and action space.

It is noteworthy that agents in a multi-agent system (MAS) may take actions that can have direct consequences on neighbouring agents, which may have further impact on other agents within the network. For instance, if a relaying agent decides to increase the transmit power beyond some threshold value, in order to boost its communication capabilities, its action may result in channel interference to its immediate neighbours, and worst, it may deplete its energy fast, and die-out, leading to link failure that can affect the performance of the entire network. Issues like this may arise in a typical multi-agent IoT network, as such, we present a fully-decentralised MAS where each agents learn to follow a local policy that improves the global objective. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that employs a decentralised RL technique to minimize global outage in communication within a fog-based IoT network, taking into consideration the wireless channel conditions, by jointly optimizing the location of each relaying agent and the power-control parameter.

In this paper, we assume the following.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The MFRA is completely oblivious of its environment, and as such, has no prior knowledge of the overall cost function.
  \item The MRFA may change its position in order to ensure better communication. Also, the MFRA may change its position (2D/3D) depending on the scenario considered.
  \item The MFRA has an objective of learning to make actions that yield better outcomes within its local view of the environment.
  \item The states are be divided into discrete levels to overcome the exponential decay in the efficiency of the proposed approach due infinite state space.
  \item Each MFRA independently tries to optimize power usage and moves in a direction that maximizes the communication outage.
\end{enumerate}








In Fig. \ref{ideafig1}, we present a situation where different IoT end-devices, inclusive of smart things embedded with sensors (smart-meters, smart-watches, traffic lights, washing machine, dish-washers, herds, or even a sick patient being monitored, etc.), which can send data/service request to a remote fog service provider via a MFRA. However, there may be change in the topology of the network or even in the environment, making it difficult for data collection or service provision. Furthermore, the environment may be too hazardous for human control and as such, some level of intelligence is expected from the MFRA. The MFRA learns to optimize its position and adjust it's power-level to minimize the communication outage.

However, the dynamic IoT environment increases the complexity in system design, as such, many classical approaches will fail when domain knowledge of the environment mismatches the actual environment~\cite{Yau2012}.

 In Fig. \ref{ideafig1}, we present micro-view of randomly deployed IoT sensors trying to send/receive data/service request to a remote fog device via a potential mobile fog-relay agent (MFRA). Intuitively, if a fog device does not have the required computational/processing capability, it may decide to forward the data/service request to other available fog devices.

\section{Idea 2}
\label{sec:Idea2a}
\subsection{Problem Formulation}

Devices/agents in an IoT network are resource-constrained, as such, it will be proper to deploy lightweight RL-based techniques that will improve the performance of the network. Furthermore, we may have to experiment on a very dynamic environment considering factors that depict a realistic IoT scenario to meet strict quality-of-service requirements.

In this work, a finite-horizon MDP is considered with continuous state and action spaces defined by the tuple~$\langle \mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, p, p_0, \mathcal{P}_{out}, \gamma \rangle$, where~$\mathcal{S}$ is the set of states,~$\mathcal{A}$ is the set of actions,~$p: \mathcal{S}\times \mathcal{A} \times \mathcal{S} \rightarrow \mathbb{G}^+$ is the conditional probability density over successor states given the current state and action,~$p_0: \mathcal{S} \rightarrow \mathbb{G}^+ $ is the probability density over initial states,~$\mathcal{P}_{out}$ is a function that maps state to cost, and the discount factor is~$\gamma \in (0,1]$.
In the RL techniques, the agent has a choice to take certain actions in each time step, causing the environment to respond with new conditions, and consequently, the agent receives reward for that action as a form of feedback. The reward could be positive, negative or even zero, and the main objective of the agent is to maximize the positive reward or minimize the negative reward (often the cost) over the entire time step~$N$.

Our objective is to learn a stochastic policy~$\pi^*: \mathcal{S}\times \mathcal{A}\rightarrow \mathbb{G}^+,$ which is a conditional probability density over the present state, in such a way as to minimize the expected cumulative cost.


\begin{equation}\label{eqn4}
\pi^* = \arg \min_{\pi} \mathbb{E}_{s_0, a_0, s_1, a_1, ..., s_N} \Big[ \sum_{i=0}^{N} \gamma^i \mathcal{P}_{out}(s_i) \Big],
\end{equation}

We take the expectation over the joint distribution of all state-action pairs, with the density give as,

\begin{equation}\label{eqn5}
q(s_0, a_0, s_1, a_1, ..., s_N) = p_0(s_0) \prod_{i=0}^{N-1} \pi(a_i|s_i) p(s_{i+1}|s_i, a_i).
\end{equation}



Fig. \ref{fogmodel} shows a dynamic IoT environment with an IoT sensor attempting to request some services from a remote target fog agent/node through randomly deployed fog devices. The devices act as relays to forward traffic from the source to the destination. However, based on their position, line-of-sight(LoS) obstruction, which affect the conditions of the wireless channel, some degree of communication outage may occur. Our aim is to ensure that the agents are able to learn the optimal route to take through their experience with the environment.
